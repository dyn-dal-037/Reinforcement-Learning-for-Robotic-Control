# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Robotic-Control

This repository explores **reinforcement learning algorithms for robotic control**, with a focus on **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** and **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** in continuous control environments.

The current implementation is tested on the **BipedalWalker** environment, with emphasis on understanding:
- Reward design
- Stability constraints
- Policy convergence
- Feedback-based control strategies

---

## Current Status

🚧 **Work in Progress**

- Core SAC components (agent, replay buffer, networks) are implemented
- PPO experiments and architectural improvements are planned
- Additional experiments and refinements will be uploaded soon

---

## Inspiration

This project is **inspired by** the following implementation:

https://github.com/Rafael1s/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms/tree/master/BipedalWalker-Soft-Actor-Critic

The current codebase is being adapted and extended for:
- Better modularity
- Experimentation with reward shaping
- Improved stability analysis

---

## Scope

This repository is intended as a **learning and experimentation codebase** for applying deep reinforcement learning methods to robotic control problems, serving as a foundation for future work in locomotion and control.
